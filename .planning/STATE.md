## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 9 phases at fine granularity, data-first dependency chain
- Stack: Python monolith (FastAPI + APScheduler + SQLite/DuckDB + Jinja2/HTMX)
- Signal engine: Deterministic (no LLM) for core computation; LLM deferred to enrichment

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Vietnamese gold shop website structure unverified — each target site (sjc.com.vn, doji.vn, pnj.com.vn, btmc.vn) must be validated during planning
- [Phase 1]: Signal threshold calibration needs historical gap data analysis — cannot determine optimal thresholds from research alone
- [Phase 1]: International gold price API selection needed — multiple options (Kitco, MetalPriceAPI, free tiers), must evaluate limits and reliability
